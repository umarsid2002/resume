            <p class="para font3">My name is Umar Ahmed Siddiqui and I am a web developer having work experience in developing WordPress websites. My journey towards WordPress started from 24 June 2020 even when I didnâ€™t know the word of WordPress. From that day I started conducting HTML, CSS and js tutorials. HTML is a hyper text markup while CSS is a cascading style sheet and javaScript is for writing logic which deals with behaviour of web pages. In 24 Jan 2022, I got a WordPress internship in Ethnic Market Research (EMR) where my job was to assist my senior web developer in terms of building webstite. In EMR I also worked as a social media manager, managing social media platforms including YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.</p>

                <p class="para font3">
                As a web developer I also have an interest in SEO. I recently have completed an SEO course where I learned  keyword research, onpage seo, offpage seo and registering website to google search console.

            <p class="para font3">
                When it comes to team, I really like working with a team on a project. The fact is that if a website is about 4 to 5 pages, then it is okay for a single person to manage it, but if it comprises of about 10 pages or more, then it is very difficult for a person alone to manage it in all direction. Managing a website does not mean just to create content including text, images, videos, carousels, etc but that website should be responsive on all devices, speed optimized,  SEO optimized and well organized for the user who consumes it. The images of website should be resized using softwares like photoshop as per requirement. So working with complex website projects ultimately leads towards a team work which is neccessary for maintainance.</p>
