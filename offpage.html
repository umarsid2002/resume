            <p class="para font3">Off-page SEO includes activities done off of a website in an effort to increase the site's search engine rankings. Common off-page SEO actions include building backlinks, encouraging branded searches, and increasing engagement and shares on social media. In other words: off-page SEO is all the stuff that you do off of your site to get Google and other search engines to see your website as trustworthy and authoritative. This includes building high-quality backlinks from other websites, promoting content through social media and other online platforms, and engaging with online communities to increase brand awareness and reputation. Off-page SEO is important because it helps search engines to determine the relevance, popularity, and authority of a website, which in turn can lead to higher rankings in search engine results pages (SERPs). In general, it is recommended to have a well-rounded SEO strategy that includes both on-page and off-page optimization techniques. Off-page SEO can be a powerful way to improve your website's authority, visibility, and reputation in the eyes of search engines, but it should not be the sole focus of your SEO efforts. Ultimately, the goal of off-page SEO is to build a strong and sustainable online presence that will help your website to rank well in search results pages over the long term.</p>
